vim /path/to/chromedriver
After running the line above, you'll probably see a bunch of gibberish. Do the following:

Search for cdc_ by typing /cdc_ and pressing return.
Enable editing by pressing a.
Delete any amount of $cdc_lasutopfhvcZLmcfl and replace what was deleted with an equal amount characters. If you don't, chromedriver will fail.
After you're done editing, press esc.
To save the changes and quit, type :wq! and press return.
If you don't want to save the changes, but you want to quit, type :q! and press return.
You're done.
Go to the altered chromedriver and double click on it. A terminal window should open up. If you don't see killed in the output, you successfully altered the driver.

Using Perl
The line below replaces cdc_ with dog_:

perl -pi -e 's/cdc_/dog_/g' /path/to/chromedriver
Make sure that the replacement string has the same number of characters as the search string, otherwise the chromedriver will fail.




How to check if the Perl replacement worked

The following line will print every occurrence of the search string cdc_:

perl -ne 'while(/cdc_/g){print "$&\n";}' /path/to/chromedriver

If this returns nothing, then cdc_ has been replaced.

Conversely, you can use the this:

perl -ne 'while(/dog_/g){print "$&\n";}' /path/to/chromedriver

to see if your replacement string, dog_, is now in the chromedriver binary. If it is, the replacement string will be printed to the console.

Go to the altered chromedriver and double click on it. A terminal window should open up. If you don't see killed in the output, you successfully altered the driver.
